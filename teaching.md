### SPRING 2013

I am currently a teaching fellow for [CS 181](http://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs181/), an awesome course on machine learning taught by a great professor. It&#8217;s one of the few classes that combines mathematics (probability and statistics) with computer programming, and moreover is a great intro to one of the most interesting disciplines in computer science.

### Fall 2011

I was a teaching fellow for [AM 221](http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k82485) (Advanced Optimization), which is a great class on linear programming and combinatorial optimization, covering more interesting topics such as column generation and other neat theory.

### Spring 2011

I was a teaching fellow for [AM 121](http://courses.fas.harvard.edu/~apm121) (Intro to Linear Optimization) at Harvard. Optimization is a really exciting subject that many schools don&#8217;t teach their undergrads. Highly recommended!

### Spring 2009

As an undergraduate at theÂ  University of Pennsylvania, I was a TA twice for CIS 320, the undergraduate algorithms course, with <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sanjeev" target="_blank">Sanjeev Khanna</a> teaching.
