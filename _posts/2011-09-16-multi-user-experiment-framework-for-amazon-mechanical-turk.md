At NYCE 2011, many of you expressed interest in the framework I demonstrated for automatically setting up and running real-time experiments involving multiple users on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

I hope to open source my code in the future and make it available. I&#8217;ve been personally calling the software &#8216;TurkServer&#8217; and I suppose this is a good name that will stick. I will also put up a page on this site with more information about the capabilities of TurkServer. Please e-mail me if you would like more information.
