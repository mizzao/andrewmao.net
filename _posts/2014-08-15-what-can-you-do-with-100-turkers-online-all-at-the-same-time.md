The following screenshot shows a recent study we deployed with the [TurkServer](https://github.com/HarvardEconCS/turkserver-meteor) framework. We pulled out all the stops for this one, resulting in 100 participants arriving within 2 minutes of each other. They all participated for over one hour.

In our case, we randomized them into different-sized groups for some really exciting science that I&#8217;m hoping to share soon. The simultaneous recruitment was necessary for all of our treatments to experience the same population, and the biggest group of users had 32 participants.

This methodology and software we&#8217;ve been developing for experimental research is quite a powerful hammer &#8211; what&#8217;s your nail?
