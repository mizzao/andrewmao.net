[Sid Suri](http://www.sidsuri.com/) and I recently gave a tutorial at [WINE 2013](http://wine13.seas.harvard.edu/) on the opportunities and practice of online behavioral experiments. We&#8217;re excited to share this because studying online behavior is a compelling opportunity for computer scientists, and we believe that experimental work nicely complements existing modeling and data mining approaches by providing a way to verify hypotheses in a controlled setting and allowing for causal claims about interventions and observations, which are important for all types of system and mechanism design. Simply put, the best way to study online behavior experimentally is to do experiments with online participants.

**[Check out the slides here.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13229094/papers/WINE13_experiments.pdf)**

Our tutorial consists of three sections: a review of how the experimental approach fits in and complements other methods for studying behavior; an overview of experimental design concepts from the abstract to the practical,  including examples of pitfalls from our own experiments; and a survey of methods and tools that have been used in different fields to conduct experiments online.

Whether you were at the tutorial or not, we&#8217;d be happy to hear feedback on the material and what you&#8217;d like to learn more about. If you were to attend this tutorial in the future, or attend a summer school for online experiments, what would you like to see?
