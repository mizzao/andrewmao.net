When are the greatest number of workers available on Mechanical Turk?

The answer to this question isn&#8217;t just about when to post HITs. A few requesters on MTurk, such as myself, often use tasks where many workers must be online at the same time, and sometimes we want this number to be as large as possible. In our case, it&#8217;s for research on simultaneous interaction between many participants. In order to do this, we typically schedule a time in advance and notify users to show up at that time.

Scheduling for this has usually been ad hoc, but in my last round of recruiting I decided to collect some extra data from workers about their availability, normalized by timezone. The following graph shows the distribution of over 1,200 workers available in each hour, per their reports:

The buckets are shown from 9AM to 11PM GMT -5, but are computed from the users&#8217; original timezones. A few caveats: the graph is for a few hundred US workers only, and the method of collection could be biased by time of day effects (the time of day that we collected the data will affect the time preferences of users.) However, the pattern squares with previous anecdotal observations that either the mid-afternoon or late evening are the best time to post group tasks, and that people don&#8217;t tend to be online as much in the morning or at dinner time.

What happens when one starts using this panel of workers? After running a few dozen synchronous experiments all at 2PM EDT, the distribution of the remaining times now looks like the following, with just over 900 workers available. (For now, we are using each worker only once.)

As you can see, we&#8217;ve drastically reduced the number of workers available at 2PM, while not really affecting the number of workers available at 9PM. In order to get the maximum number of workers online simultaneously for our next synchronous batch, we&#8217;d do best to shoot for 9PM instead.

Keep in mind that there can be strong time-of-day effects here, as there are dissimilar populations likely to be online at certain times. Because of this, we&#8217;ll be randomizing over all of our possible experimental treatments simultaneously, so that the effect hits all of them. Collecting this time-of-day data is almost essential for overcoming the significant challenges in scheduling a large number of unique users all online at the same time.

The graphs above were generated by the [TurkServer](https://github.com/HarvardEconCS/turkserver-meteor) framework I&#8217;m building to support designing and deploying real-time, synchronous, web-based experimental studies. Stay tuned for some awesome research that we&#8217;ll be sharing soon.

Is this pattern reflected by your experience as well? I&#8217;d love to hear about it.
