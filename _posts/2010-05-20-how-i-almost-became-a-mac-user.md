After waiting many months for Apple to finally update their Macbook Pro line, I finally gave in on my urge for a new computer and got the [Sony Vaio Z](http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&storeId=10151&langId=-1&categoryId=8198552921644570897). Apple did indeed update their Macbook Pros on April 13th, 2010, but the hardware just doesn&#8217;t compare to the Z.

The Vaio Z is lighter (at just 3 lbs) than the Macbook Air, but faster than the Macbook Pro with its Core i5/i7 Arrandale processor. At just 13.1 inches (the perfect size for me,) it also comes with a default resolution of 1600&#215;900 &#8211; but you can also go for the ridiculous 13.1&#8243; 1080p screen if you have eagle vision. Tack on the 3 or 4 SSD&#8217;s in RAID 0, along with the hybrid graphics (Geforce GT 330M + Arrandale IGP) and you have a clear winner. Other benefits: noise-canceling earbuds included, and 2.0MP webcam.

The only issue now is to get Linux working on this bad boy. I&#8217;ll probably wait a bit to see how the new kernels fare with hybrid graphics and raid 0 on device-mapper, then jump right in with Gentoo.
