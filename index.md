I am a research scientist at [CTRL-labs], where we are building the next
generation of human interface devices by [directly connecting your nervous
system to computers][reardon-talk] using custom hardware sensors and machine
learning. If you're interested in joining a company where awesome people are
working on an enormous vision, [we are hiring][ctrl-jobs]!

In general, I enjoy building intelligent systems of people and computers. My
expertise spans machine learning, data visualization, human-computer
interaction, software engineering, experiment design, causal inference,
economics, and statistics.

<!--
My main research interests are to motivate and understand the design of hybrid
systems of humans and computers in online, interconnected settings, and
algorithms that are aware of human behavior. I approach this problem primarily
by using Internet-based online behavioral experiments to study collaboration and
interaction between people at large scale. I also build and test models that
capture and predict empirical behavioral data, and design algorithms and social
systems that reflect realistic participation by people.

My research covers topics including collective intelligence, crowdsourcing,
human computation, online communities, peer production, and information
aggregation, using an array of tools including statistical modeling, machine
learning, optimization, game theory, and computational and experimental
approaches.

Previously, I was part of the [Computational Social Science][css] group at
[Microsoft Research NYC][msrnyc]. I hold B.S. degrees in Computer Science and
Finance from the University of Pennsylvania, and a S.M. and Ph.D. from Harvard
University, where I was advised by [Yiling Chen][yiling] as part of the [EconCS
group][econcs].
