Hey there! I'm currently looking for the next opportunity to work with great
people on an interesting project. See my [**resume**](/resume) or [**academic
CV**](/cv).

I love building intelligent systems of people and computers, and working with
multidisciplinary teams that make those systems possible. I draw from broad
experience spanning entrepreneurship, product management, machine learning, data
visualization, software engineering, human-computer interaction, experiment
design, and economics.

Previously, I was a research scientist turned product manager at [CTRL-labs],
where we imagined the future of human interface devices by [directly connecting
your nervous system to computers][ctrl-video] using custom hardware sensors and
machine learning.

My main research interests are to motivate and understand the design of hybrid
systems of humans and computers in online, interconnected settings, and
algorithms that are aware of human behavior. I approach this problem primarily
by using Internet-based online behavioral experiments to study collaboration and
interaction between people at large scale. I also build and test models that
capture and predict empirical behavioral data, and design algorithms and social
systems that reflect realistic participation by people.

My research covers topics including collective intelligence, crowdsourcing,
human computation, online communities, peer production, and information
aggregation, using an array of tools including statistical modeling, machine
learning, optimization, game theory, and computational and experimental
approaches.

Before that, I was part of the [Computational Social Science][css] group at
[Microsoft Research NYC][msrnyc], where I built web applications to conduct
large-scale studies of social behavior.

I hold B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Finance from the University of
Pennsylvania, and a S.M. and Ph.D. from Harvard University, where I was advised
by [Yiling Chen][yiling] as part of the [EconCS group][econcs].
