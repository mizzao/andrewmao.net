My main research interests are to motivate and understand the design of hybrid
systems of humans and computers in online, interconnected settings, and
algorithms that are aware of human behavior. I approach this problem primarily
by using Internet-based online behavioral experiments to study collaboration and
interaction between people at large scale. I also build and test models that
capture and predict empirical behavioral data, and design algorithms and social
systems that reflect realistic participation by people.

My research covers topics including collective intelligence, crowdsourcing,
human computation, online communities, peer production, and information
aggregation, using an array of tools including statistical modeling, machine
learning, optimization, game theory, and computational and experimental
approaches.

Previously, I was part of the [Computational Social Science][css] group at [Microsoft Research NYC][msrnyc].
I hold B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Finance from the University of
Pennsylvania, and a S.M. and Ph.D. from Harvard University, where I was advised by [Yiling Chen][yiling] as part of the [EconCS group][econcs].
