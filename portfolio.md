I love to learn new things and figure out the best way to get something done.
Here are various projects I've worked on; everything from software and data to
physical things.

### [Parsnip][parsnip-link]

Parsnip is "Duolingo for cooking", teaching cooking techniques as you prepare
recipes. Our long term goal was to create a food data platform for the home
kitchen, powering an AI assistant for meal planning, grocery shopping, and
cooking.

### [CTRL-labs][ctrl-link]

CTRL-labs created a wearable device that used machine learning to decode
neuromuscular signals. My work included setting up the machine learning
platform, building demo applications, and product management for momentary event
detection and rollout of our cloud-based personalized machine learning
infrastructure. The company was [acquired by Facebook in 2019][ctrl-fb].
