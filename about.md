I am cur<img class="wp-image-49 alignleft" title="me" src="http://www.andrewmao.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/single.jpg" alt="me" width="218" height="290" />rently a postdoc at [Microsoft Research NYC](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/newyork/), with a focus in [computational](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/cssnyc/) and [experimental social science](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/oess_nyc/).

My main research interests are to motivate and understand the design of hybrid systems of humans and computers in online, interconnected settings, and algorithms that are aware of human behavior. I approach this problem primarily by using Internet-based online behavioral experiments to study collaboration and interaction between people at large scale. I also build and test models that capture and predict empirical behavioral data, and design algorithms and social systems that reflect realistic participation by people.

My research covers topics including collective intelligence, crowdsourcing, human computation, online communities, peer production, and information aggregation, using an array of tools including statistical modeling, machine learning, optimization, game theory, and computational and experimental approaches.

I received B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Finance from the University of Pennsylvania, and S.M. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University as part of the <a href="http://www.econcs.seas.harvard.edu" target="_blank">EconCS group</a>, where I was advised by <a href="http://www.yiling.seas.harvard.edu" target="_blank">Yiling Chen</a>.

In college, I worked on systems and security research at the University of Pennsylvania with <a href="http://www.chopsticksandlox.com" target="_blank">Micah Sherr</a> and <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~boonloo" target="_blank">Boon Thau Loo</a>. As a result, I am happy to apply my systems knowledge to new projects and tackle research that involves engineering, implementation, or empirical challenges.
