I love building intelligent systems of people and computers, and working with
multidisciplinary teams that make those systems possible. I draw from broad
experience spanning entrepreneurship, product management, machine learning, data
visualization, software engineering, human-computer interaction, experiment
design, and economics.

## Experience

### ![Parsnip][parsnip-icon] [Parsnip]
*2020—present*{: .right}
*Co-founder*\\
Parsnip is "Duolingo for cooking", teaching cooking techniques as you prepare
your meals. Our long term goal was to create a food data platform for the home
kitchen, powering an AI assistant for meal planning, grocery shopping, and
cooking.

I recruited a founding team, built several iterations of the product, raised
$200k from angel investors, and learned a ton from making many mistakes.

### ![CTRL-labs][ctrl-icon] [CTRL-labs] ([acquired by Facebook][ctrl-fb])
*2017—2019*{: .right}
*Research Scientist & Product Manager* (New York, NY)\\
Designed a machine learning platform for organizing 1TB+ of time series datasets
& TensorFlow models, and automating model performance benchmarks on test data.
Prototyped 2D and 3D interaction applications for demonstrating user interface
control via machine learning from electromyography data.

Led a cross-team effort to build cloud infrastructure for training
user-personalized machine learning models. Product manager for momentary
event/signal detection from electromyography data, including R&D, data
collection, accuracy metrics, user interface design, implementation, and product
release.
