Web-based framework for building "virtual lab" experiments. See also [the 
guide](http://turkserver.readthedocs.io/).

math and machine learning library. Specifically includes many implementations of social choice/voting rules and fitting random utility models.

#### [Voting Data](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13229094/papers/voting-results.tar.gz)

social choice/ranking data at various levels of noise, collected on Amazon Mechanical Turk. (See these data sets on PrefLib: [dots](http://www.preflib.org/data/election/dots/), 
[puzzle](http://www.preflib.org/data/election/puzzle/), or the original 
[paper](research).) 
Additionally, we have more detailed data:

  * <span style="line-height: 14px;">The original images and 8-puzzles presented to users</span>
  * The sequence of partial orders generated as they dragged/dropped to get to these final results.

If you are interested in any of the above, please contact me and I can make them available as well.
