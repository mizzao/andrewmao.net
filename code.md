#### [Voting Data](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/mf0mm153pe3f12w/voting-results.tar.gz)

social choice/ranking data at various levels of noise, collected on Amazon Mechanical Turk. (See these data sets on PrefLib: [dots](http://www.preflib.org/data/election/dots/),
[puzzle](http://www.preflib.org/data/election/puzzle/), or the original
[paper](/research).)
Additionally, we have more detailed data:

  * <span style="line-height: 14px;">The original images and 8-puzzles presented to users</span>
  * The sequence of partial orders generated as they dragged/dropped to get to these final results.

If you are interested in any of the above, please contact me and I can make them available as well.
