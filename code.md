#### [Voting Data](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13229094/papers/voting-results.tar.gz)

social choice/ranking data at various levels of noise, collected on Amazon Mechanical Turk. ([See associated paper](http://www.andrewmao.net/research "Papers").) Additionally, we have more detailed data:

  * <span style="line-height: 14px;">The original images and 8-puzzles presented to users</span>
  * The sequence of partial orders generated as they dragged/dropped to get to these final results.

If you are interested in any of the above, please contact me and I can make them available as well.
